Note: 
This app is for demonstration only, it does not use security or follow best practices, I took a short cut and did not create a model for the app and feed the data directly to grid's data source. This would not work for anything more than this demo.

I have a seperate app for the API, but have not used it, I use JSON Server to prototype, my intention was to use it, but I ran into so many issues with my laptop. 

I used Material for its UI Components, Grid and Datepicker, because its free. 

# CustomerClientApp
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

# install JSON Serve 
and run the following in a seperat terminal:
 json-server --watch db.json

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
